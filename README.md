# Come get a Sneak Peek! ðŸ‘Ÿ
Sneak Peek is a sneaker catolog app that is for all sneaker enthusiasts alike. This sneaker catalog features some of the World&#39;s most well-known brands, such as Jordans, Nikes, and Adidas. I hope everyone will enjoy this app as much as I do. This app allows the user to search by shoe brands only. Come get a Sneak Peek and checkout your favorite sneaker today!
## Planning Story
Sneak Peak is a passion project that I fell in love with ever since I concieved of the idea. My love of sneakers represents my very being and I wanted to showcase that through this app.

The goal of Sneak Peak is create an encyclopedia that can be used as a reference for users that interested in learning about iconic sneakers i.e. full name of the sneaker, release date, and image.

My initial approach was to create an identity for the app: creating a wireframe, choose a name, color scheme, and the main image. Also, I researched about API's that would offer the data needed to build the app. Secondly, I decided to divide my process into three stages. 1.) Having visuals and a search function. 2.) & 3.) Be able to gather more data to make it an encyclopedia.

## Unsolved Problems/Strived Goals
For future iterations of the Sneak Peak app, I would like to add more
features such as the users having the ability to read of the history behind their favorite sneakers, public figures seen wearing sneakers, and random sneaker fun facts.
