      <p className='about-me'>Hi there! My name is Maxwell Kwarteng. My love for sneakers and shoes trescends that of time. It all began in the early 90&#39;s when I used to watch the New York Knicks with Latrell Sprewell alongside my Dad and ask about the cool basketball shoes I saw on TV. Watching Michael Jordan soar to the basket in his legendary shoes was awe inspiring and jaw-dropping. I knew then I was in love with sneakers. Everything from their designs, to their functions, and even down to their technologies, I had to know more of. One of my favorite quotes &quot;It must be the shoes&quot;, still resonates with me to this very day. When I&#39;m not thinking about sneakers or shoes, I enjoy powerlifting, hiking, running, and swimming. I also enjoy cooking and spending quality time with friends and family.</p>
